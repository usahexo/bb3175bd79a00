        <h1 id="Missouri-Becomes-First-State-To-Ban-Double-Zero-Roulette"><a href="#Missouri-Becomes-First-State-To-Ban-Double-Zero-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="Missouri Becomes First State To Ban Double-Zero Roulette"></a>Missouri Becomes First State To Ban Double-Zero Roulette</h1><p>In a surprise move on Tuesday, Missouri’s state legislature voted to ban the playing of double-zero roulette in the state. This makes Missouri the first state in the country to prohibit the game, which has been controversial because of its high house edge.</p>
<p>The legislation was introduced by State Senator Dave Schatz, who said that the ban was necessary in order to protect Missouri’s citizens from being taken advantage of. “This is a predatory game that targets our most vulnerable citizens,” Schatz said. “It’s time for us to stand up and protect our people.”</p>
<p>The bill passed both chambers of the legislature with bipartisan support and now awaits Governor Eric Greitens’ signature. If signed, it will take effect on August 28th.</p>
<p>Double-zero roulette is a version of the game where the wheel has two zeroes instead of one. This increases the house edge from 5.26% to 7.89%, making it significantly more costly for players to gamble on the game. Many casinos around the country have stopped offering it in response to public pressure, but there are still some that allow it.</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) released a statement opposing the bill, calling it “bad policy” that would cost Missourians jobs and revenue. “Banning this type of gaming is counterproductive and will only lead to losses for our state,” said AGA Senior Vice President Bill Miller.</p>
<p>But supporters of the bill argue that casinos can still offer other games that have similar house edges, such as blackjack or craps. “There’s no reason why we can’t protect our citizens while still allowing these businesses to thrive,” Schatz said.</p>
<h1 id="Could-Missouri-Roulette-Ban-Spell-The-End-For-Double-Zero-Games"><a href="#Could-Missouri-Roulette-Ban-Spell-The-End-For-Double-Zero-Games" class="headerlink" title="Could Missouri Roulette Ban Spell The End For Double-Zero Games?"></a>Could Missouri Roulette Ban Spell The End For Double-Zero Games?</h1><p>Roulette is a game that has been enjoyed by people for centuries. It is believed to have originated in Belgium in the 17th century, and the classic version that we know today developed in France in the 18th century. There are different variations of roulette, but the most popular one is American roulette, which has 38 slots numbered 0-36, as well as two green slots marked 00 and 0.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been talk of banning roulette in Missouri, as some lawmakers believe that it is too risky and could lead to financial ruin for players. The bill was proposed by Republican representative Tony Dugger, who believes that the odds are stacked against players and that they are too likely to lose money. If the bill is passed, it could spell the end for double-zero games in Missouri casinos.</p>
<p>The proposed bill would ban all forms of roulette in Missouri casinos, including American roulette and its European variant. It would also prohibit electronic versions of the game. Casinos would be given a year to remove all roulette games from their premises, and anyone caught playing or hosting a game would faces fines of up to $5,000.</p>
<p>So far, there hasn’t been much reaction to the proposed ban from Missouri’s gaming industry. However, if it does pass into law, it could mean big changes for casino operators in the state. There are currently three casinos in Missouri which offer roulette games – Ameristar Casino Kansas City, Harrah’s North Kansas City Casino &amp; Hotel, and Hollywood Casino St Charles. All of these casinos would need to remove their roulette games if the bill becomes law.</p>
<p>It’s not clear whether the proposed ban will ever become law. However, if it does pass, it could have a significant impact on Missouri’s casino industry.</p>
<h1 id="Missouri-Becomes-Latest-State-To-Reject-Double-Zero-Roulette"><a href="#Missouri-Becomes-Latest-State-To-Reject-Double-Zero-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="Missouri Becomes Latest State To Reject Double-Zero Roulette"></a>Missouri Becomes Latest State To Reject Double-Zero Roulette</h1><p>In a unanimous decision on Wednesday, the Missouri House of Representatives voted against legalizing double-zero roulette in the state, following in the footsteps of their counterparts in Indiana and Louisiana.</p>
<p>Opposition to the game was led by Republican Representative Charlie Davis of O’Fallon, who argued that it would be unfair to casinos and their customers. “This is a billion-dollar industry we’re talking about,” Davis said. “To put a game in there where the house has an automatic advantage - it’s just not fair.”</p>
<p>Proponents of the game, including Democratic Representative Jeremy LaFaver of Kansas City, countered that it would generate much-needed revenue for the state. They also noted that the game is popular in other parts of the country and would give Missouri casinos a competitive edge.</p>
<p>In the end, however, the arguments of Davis prevailed and double-zero roulette was rejected by a vote of 112 to 44.</p>
<h1 id="Missouri-Joins-Growing-List-Of-States-to-Ban-Double-Zero-Roulette"><a href="#Missouri-Joins-Growing-List-Of-States-to-Ban-Double-Zero-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="Missouri Joins Growing List Of States to Ban Double-Zero Roulette"></a>Missouri Joins Growing List Of States to Ban Double-Zero Roulette</h1><p>Missouri has just passed a bill banning the playing of double-zero roulette in the state. The bill was signed into law by Governor Mike Parson on Monday, making Missouri the latest in a string of states to outlaw the statistically unfavorable game.</p>
<p>In recent years, more and more states have been banning double-zero roulette in an effort to protect their citizens from being taken advantage of by the house edge. The game, which features two zeroes on the wheel as opposed to one in single-zero roulette, gives the house a significantly larger edge and has been dubbed “the most unfair casino game” by many experts.</p>
<p>The new Missouri law will take effect on August 28th, 2019. It joins a growing list of states that have outlawed double-zero roulette, including Nevada, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<h1 id="Missouri-Leads-The-Way-In-The-Fight-Against-Double-Zero-Roulette"><a href="#Missouri-Leads-The-Way-In-The-Fight-Against-Double-Zero-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="Missouri Leads The Way In The Fight Against Double-Zero Roulette"></a>Missouri Leads The Way In The Fight Against Double-Zero Roulette</h1><p>In the early 2000s, Missouri became the first US state to ban double-zero roulette. The move was largely in response to concerns over the fairness of the game, which gave casinos a significant edge over players.</p>
<p>Since then, a number of other states have followed suit, with Illinois and New Jersey both passing bills outlawing the game in recent years.</p>
<p>Supporters of the ban argue that it’s simply too risky to play, as casinos can make up to a 5.26% profit on every spin of the wheel. This makes it difficult for players to win consistently – even when following basic strategies.</p>
<p>Critics of the ban argue that it denies players access to what is essentially a fair game. They also claim that banning double-zero roulette will simply lead casinos to offer more games with higher odds, making it even harder for players to win.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no definitive study on the impact of banning double-zero roulette. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that it has led to a modest increase in casino profits across Missouri.</p>
