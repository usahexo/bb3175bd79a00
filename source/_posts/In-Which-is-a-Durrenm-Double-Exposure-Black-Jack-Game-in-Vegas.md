#  In Which is a Durrenm Double Exposure Black Jack Game in Vegas?

DURENM is a double exposure black jack game in vegas. It is a game that offers players the opportunity to enjoy two games at the same time. In this game, players are allowed to see both of the dealer's cards. This gives players an advantage when it comes to making decisions about whether or not to hit, stand, split, or double down.

The rules for playing durrenm are very similar to those of traditional black jack. Players are dealt two cards and then have the opportunity to draw additional cards in order to get as close as possible to 21 without going over. The player's goal is to beat the dealer's hand, without going bust.

Players can win durrenm by getting a higher score than the dealer, without going over 21. They can also win if the dealer goes bust. If both the player and dealer have the same score, then the game is considered a tie and no one wins or loses money.

One of the benefits of playing durrenm is that players have more control over their destiny than they do in traditional black jack. With traditional black jack, dealers have an edge over players because they can see one of their own cards while players can only see one of the dealer's cards. In durrenm, players can see both of the dealer's cards which gives them a bit of an advantage.

Although durrenm offers players an advantage over traditional black jack, it is still important to make sound decisions when playing this game. Just because you can see both of the dealer's cards doesn't mean you should always hit or stand. You need to take into account your own hand as well as the dealer's hand before making any decisions.
