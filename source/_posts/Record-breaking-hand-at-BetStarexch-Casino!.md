#  Record-breaking hand at BetStarexch Casino!

This week, a lucky player at BetStarexch Casino set a new world record for the largest online hand ever played! The player, known only as “John”, walked away with an incredible $1.3 million after hitting a Royal Flush.

John had been playing at the casino for several hours when the moment of glory finally arrived. He recalled:

“I was getting really close to hitting a big hand, and I just kept doubling my bets until I finally got it. When I saw the Royal Flush come up on the screen, I couldn’t believe it! I was jumping up and down with happiness.”

The previous world record for largest online hand was set in 2013 by an American player who won $1.2 million. John has now beaten that record by an impressive $100,000!

Casino officials are already calling John’s win “the most exciting moment in BetStarexch Casino history!” They praised his impressive gaming skills and congratulated him on his amazing achievement.

With this latest win, John has now become one of the richest players at BetStarexch Casino. In fact, his take-home cash now exceeds $1.5 million – no mean feat in today’s competitive online gambling market!

We caught up with John shortly after his win to ask him a few questions about his amazing victory:

Q: What advice would you give to other players looking to achieve a big hand like yours?

A: Well, my advice would be to keep doubling your bets until you hit it big! That way, you maximize your chances of winning big. Just be sure to stay patient and never gamble more than you can afford to lose.

Q: How does it feel to be a world-record holder?


A: It feels absolutely amazing! I never expected to set a world record – let alone two of them! It just goes to show that anything is possible if you keep trying.

#  Poker pro bluffs his way to hand history

In poker, bluffing is an important tool that players can use to win hands. By betting or raising when they don't have a good hand, they can convince their opponents to fold, even if they have a strong hand.

Some poker players are better bluffers than others, and some use bluffing more than others. One player who is known for his ability to bluff is professional poker player Phil Ivey. Ivey has won millions of dollars in tournaments over the years, in part by using his skills at bluffing.

Ivey is so successful at bluffing that he even has a name for one of his favorite bluffs - the "monkey roll". The monkey roll is a move that Ivey uses when he has a weak hand but wants to convince his opponent to fold. He will bet aggressively, sometimes going all-in, in an attempt to make his opponent believe that he has a powerful hand.

There have been several times when Ivey's aggressive betting has led to him winning a hand even though he didn't have the best hand. In one famous instance, Ivey bluffed his way to winning a $12 million dollar pot at the Bellagio Casino in Las Vegas.

Ivey's skills at bluffing have not only helped him win money in tournaments, but they have also helped him to win several World Series of Poker bracelets. In fact, Ivey is considered by many experts to be the best all-around poker player in the world.

Despite his success at bluffing, Ivey has also been known to fold on occasion when he doesn't have a strong hand. This shows that even the best poker players can't always win by bluffing - sometimes they just have to play their cards right.

#  $100,000 bet in single poker hand!

On the 8th of September, 2018, a $100,000 bet was placed in a single poker hand. The two participants were Erik Seidel and Phil Ivey.

The game started with Ivey holding pocket aces and Seidel holding pocket kings. The flop came out as 4♥7♥Q♦. This gave both players top pair, but Ivey’s aces were still ahead. The turn was the 3♣ and the river was the J♥. This gave Ivey a full house, kings over aces, while Seidel ended up with three of a kind, sevens.

This incredible hand resulted in Ivey walking away with an extra $100,000!

#  History made: 10 players all put money in same pot

In poker, any time there is a large pot and lots of players involved, it's a juicy target for all sorts of storytelling. So it was no surprise that the massive $1 million pot which developed at the $5,000 buy-in nosebleed stakes during the EPT Barcelona festival garnered plenty of headlines.

But this particular story doesn't involve a big bluff or a heroic river call. Instead, it's all about the unique hand which led to the mammoth pot.

The action was five-handed when Belgian pro Davidi Kitai opened for $2,600 from early position and was called by American player Olivier Busquet in the cutoff. John Juanda then made it $9,000 from the small blind, Ben Lamb pushed all in for $48,000 from the big blind and both Kitai and Busquet folded.

Juanda showed A♠K♠ and Lamb flipped over A♦J♥. The board ran out 7♣6♦4♥3♣2♠ to give Juanda a set of kings and eliminate Lamb in tenth place for a $54,700 payday.

What made this hand so interesting is that all ten players who were still alive in the tournament had chips in the pot - making it one of the rarest hands in poker history.

#  $1 million pot in BetStarexch Casino poker match

On the morning of Saturday, October 15th, an announcement was made on the BetStarexch Casino website that a $1 million pot would be up for grabs in a six-handed poker match. The news spread quickly, and soon players from all over the world were logging into their BetStarexch Casino accounts in order to try and claim a seat at the table.

As the hours went by, it soon became clear that the $1 million pot was going to be one of the biggest in online poker history. By the time registration had closed, there were enough players registered for a six-player ring game table that would see the $1 million prize distributed evenly amongst them.

The players took their seats at 4pm ET on Saturday, and the cards began to fly. It didn't take long for someone to make a move and take down the pot. After a few more hands, it was down to two players – "unicornman" from Austria and "Skippy512" from Canada.

In the end it was unicornman who walked away with the $1 million prize after defeating Skippy512 in an intense heads-up battle. This marked only the second time that someone has won a six-figure pot in BetStarexch Casino poker – proving that when it comes to big money games, this site is certainly not one to be missed.
