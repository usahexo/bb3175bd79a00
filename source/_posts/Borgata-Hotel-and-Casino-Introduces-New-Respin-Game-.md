#  Borgata Hotel and Casino Introduces New Respin Game 

The Borgata Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City is reintroducing a popular slot game that offers players the chance to respin their wins. The game, which is called “Reel Spinners”, is a five-reel, 20-payline video slot that has been tweaked to give players more control over their destiny.

In the original version of the game, if you hit a winning combination you were pretty much stuck with whatever payout you received. With the new “Reel Spinners” game, however, you now have the ability to respin any or all of your winning combinations for an additional bet – and with potentially higher payouts.

This new feature has already generated a lot of excitement among slots fans, and it’s likely to be a big hit at the Borgata. So if you enjoy playing slots and want to have a bit more control over your winnings, be sure to check out “Reel Spinners” when you visit the casino.
