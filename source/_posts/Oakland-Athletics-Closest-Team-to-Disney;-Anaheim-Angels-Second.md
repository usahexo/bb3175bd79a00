#  Oakland Athletics Closest Team to Disney; Anaheim Angels Second

The Oakland Athletics are the closest team to Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. The Angels are a close second.

Both the Athletics and Angels stadiums are about a 15-minute drive from the Resort. If you’re looking for some pre-game fun or post-game fun, the Resort is the place to be.

Disneyland Park is home to classic attractions like Space Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Haunted Mansion. There’s also new attractions like Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge and Pixar Pier. Disney California Adventure Park has even more family-friendly fun with attractions like Incredicoaster, Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: BREAKOUT! and Toy Story Midway Mania!.

There’s plenty to do outside of the parks too. Downtown Disney District is a great place to find shopping, dining, and entertainment options for everyone in your group. You can also catch a show at Disney California Adventure Park’s The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror™ or Disneyland Park’s Fantasmic!

So if you’re looking for a magical baseball road trip, consider visiting both the Oakland Athletics and Anaheim Angels stadiums.

#  Seattle Mariners a Little Further Away Than Oakland A's and Anaheim Angels

The Seattle Mariners currently find themselves nine games behind the division-leading Houston Astros in the American League West. The A's and Angels, who sit in second and third place respectively, are both just four games back of Houston. This means that the Mariners are a little further away from contention than their division rivals.

Part of the reason for Seattle's large deficit is that they have been very poor offensively this season. They rank dead last in the American League in batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage. Their lineup lacks power, as they have just 63 home runs this year, which is also last in the AL.

The good news for Seattle is that their starting pitching has been excellent. Led by ace James Paxton, their starters have a combined 3.39 ERA, which ranks third in the AL. This rotation should be able to keep them in most games, but they will need to improve their hitting if they want to make a run at the playoffs.

The A's and Angels both have powerful lineups that can score a lot of runs. The A's rank first in the AL in home runs while the Angels are third. However, both teams also have subpar pitching staffs. The A's have a 4.38 ERA as a team while the Angels' ERA is 4.27. This means that there is an opportunity for Seattle to catch up to these teams before the end of the season.

If Seattle can get some of their hitters going, they could make a serious run at the playoffs this year. The A's and Angels are beatable teams, and there is no guarantee that either of them will make it to the postseason. If Seattle plays well down the stretch, they could easily overtake one or both of these teams for a playoff spot.

#  Los Angeles Dodgers at a Disadvantage with San Manuel Casino So Close

The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians announced plans earlier this year to build a $300 million casino a mere nine miles from Dodger Stadium in the city of Industry. The project is now moving ahead after the tribe reached an agreement with two companies that would supply 1,450 slot machines and 120 gaming tables.

Casino gambling has become an important part of the revenue streams for professional sports franchises, with teams in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Massachusetts already taking advantage of the new laws allowing them to operate casinos. The new San Manuel casino would join casinos operated by the Los Angeles Rams, Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers within 30 miles of their stadiums.

While teams typically welcome the additional revenue, in this case the Dodgers are seen as being at a disadvantage. The stadium is only about 10 miles from downtown Los Angeles and its attractions, making it more convenient for fans to attend games there than travel to Industry. In addition, many residents of the Boyle Heights and East Los Angeles neighborhoods near Dodger Stadium who might be interested in gambling are likely to be opposed to having a casino so close to their homes.

The tribe has been trying to develop the site since 2007, but faced opposition from then-Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina. The new agreement calls for Molina’s company to receive 2% of gross gaming revenues from the casino, about $6 million a year. She said she changed her position after the tribe agreed to several community benefits, including increased funding for local schools and transportation improvements.

#  Texas Rangers Seem to Be the Far Away Team When it Comes to San Manuel Casino

Many may believe that the Texas Rangers are the favored baseball team when it comes to San Manuel Casino. Recent data, however, shows that this is not the case at all. In fact, the Rangers have been completely absent from any of the casino’s promotional activity.

The Oakland Athletics, on the other hand, have been featured prominently in San Manuel’s marketing materials. This is likely due to the fact that the A’s are the home team of San Manuel Casino owner, Lew Wolff. The casino has also heavily promoted games between the A’s and teams like the Detroit Tigers and Boston Red Sox.

While it may be puzzling why a casino would promote one baseball team over another, it is clear that San Manuel is attempting to court Wolff and his business interests. This should come as no surprise, as Wolff has been a vocal proponent of legalized online gambling in California.

Given that San Manuel Casino is one of the most profitable casinos in California, it makes sense for them to want to support legislation that would benefit their business. With that said, it will be interesting to see how this all plays out in terms of state politics.

#  Kansas City Royals Farthest Team from San Manuel Casino

The Kansas City Royals are the farthest team from San Manuel Casino, located in Highland, California. The casino is owned and operated by the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians. The Royals play in the American League Central division and began play in 1969.

The Royals have had a few successful seasons, including winning the World Series in 1985 and 2015. They also made it to the playoffs in 2014 and 2016. However, they have not had a winning season since 1993.

The Royals are currently in last place in their division with a record of 44-96. They will most likely not make it to the playoffs this year. This has been a disappointing season for their fans.

If you are looking for some excitement while at San Manuel Casino, be sure to check out one of their many table games or slot machines. You can also enjoy some delicious food at one of their many restaurants.
