#  Teenager fined for spending too much time gaming online

A teenager has been fined after spending too much time gaming online.

The 18-year-old, from the city of Perth in Western Australia, was fined $1,000 for repeatedly spending more than 30 hours per week playing video games.

Perth Magistrates Court heard that the teenager had admitted to spending at least 30 hours per week playing video games since March last year. The court also heard that the teenager's addiction to video games had caused him to neglect his school work and his physical health.

In delivering her ruling, magistrate Catherine infant said that the teenager's actions were "inappropriate and unacceptable". She added that the fine should serve as a warning to the teenager and to other young people about the dangers of excessive gaming.

The Perth teenager is not the first person to be fined for excessive gaming. In March last year, a 20-year-old man from Manchester in England was ordered to pay £1,200 ($1,500) after admitting to spending up to 16 hours a day playing video games.

#  Parents charged with neglect after child spends hours gaming

Police were notified after an eight-year-old boy was found unsupervised and playing video games for hours at a local game shop. When questioned by officers, the child stated that he was home alone while his parents were out working.

The child's parents have been charged with neglect, and the case is currently being reviewed by Child Protective Services. This is not the first time that parents have been charged with neglect for leaving their child unsupervised, and it is likely that it will not be the last.

There are a number of risks associated with leaving a child unsupervised, particularly for extended periods of time. Children can easily become lost or injured, and may also be targeted by predators. In addition, children who are left unsupervised are often more likely to engage in risky behaviors such as drug and alcohol use, smoking, and gambling.

Leaving a child unsupervised can also have negative consequences for their development. Children who are not supervised are more likely to have lower academic achievement and social skills. They may also be more likely to experience mental health problems such as anxiety and depression.

If you must leave your child unsupervised, it is important to take steps to ensure their safety. Make sure they know where they are going and when they will be coming home. Give them a list of emergency contact numbers and an address or map of the area where they are going. Tell them not to talk to strangers or accept candy or gifts from them.

It is also important to set ground rules for how much time your child can spend gaming or using electronic devices. Ideally, children should only be using electronic devices for one hour per day on weekdays and two hours per day on weekends. If your child insists on gaming for longer than this, consider limiting their access to specific times of the day or setting parental controls that will limit their screen time.

Leaving your child unsupervised can have disastrous consequences, so it is always best to err on the side of caution. If you have any concerns about leaving your child alone, please contact your local authorities or Child Protective Services.

#  Couple fined after their child racks up huge phone bill playing games

A couple in the UK were fined £1,700 after their child racked up a phone bill of £1,700 playing games on their device.

The bill was incurred while the child was using the family’s shared data plan, which the parents were unaware of. The parents were only made aware of the charges after their provider contacted them to say they had reached their data limit.

This case is a reminder to parents that it is important to set parental controls on devices that are shared among family members, in order to prevent accidental over-spending on apps and games.

It is also important for parents to be aware of the costs associated with data plans, and to choose one that best suits their needs. Some providers offer unlimited data plans for a fixed monthly price, which can be a more cost-effective option than paying by the megabyte.

#  Woman jailed for spending over $10,000 on in-game purchases

27-year-old Amanda from Arkansas was sentenced to two years in prison for spending over $10,000 on in-game purchases. Amanda is one of the first people to be convicted of such a crime in the United States.

According to investigators, Amanda made the purchases between 2014 and 2016 using her husband's credit card without his knowledge. The money was spent on games including "World of Warcraft," "Final Fantasy XIV" and "Destiny."

In a statement, prosecutors said that Amanda's actions had cost her husband "a great deal of money and caused him much emotional distress."

"The purchase of virtual goods with real currency can create very real losses for victims," they continued.

Judge Tim Brooks agreed, describing the crime as "an electronic version of stealing."

"This is a serious offense," he said. "It undermines confidence in our economy and it breaks hearts."

#  Man arrested for selling stolen gaming credentials

On Wednesday, a 28-year old man from the central German city of Kassel was arrested for allegedly selling stolen gaming credentials on the dark web. He is accused of advertising and selling login data for popular online games such as “World of Warcraft”, “Final Fantasy” and “Diablo 3”.

The suspect was identified by investigators after they noticed an advertisement for stolen gaming credentials on the darknet. The seller was asking for prices starting at $10 per account. In total, the investigators managed to identify more than 100 customers who had bought gaming credentials from the suspect.

The suspect is now facing charges of computer fraud and theft. If found guilty, he could be sentenced to several years in prison.
