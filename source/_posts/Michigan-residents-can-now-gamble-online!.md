#  Michigan residents can now gamble online!

Gamblers in Michigan rejoice! As of October 31st, 2017, you are now legally able to gamble online. This new law allows Michigan residents to place bets on casino games, poker, and sports through the internet.

The bill that legalized online gambling was passed by the state legislature back in September and was quickly signed into law by Governor Rick Snyder. Under the new law, the Michigan Gaming Control Board will be responsible for regulating and licensing online casinos and other gambling operators.

State Representative Brandt Iden, who sponsored the bill, believes that it will be a major boost for the state's economy. "This is about creating jobs and developing an entirely new industry in Michigan," he said.

Online gambling is already a multi-billion-dollar industry, and it is expected to grow even more in the years ahead. By legalizing it in Michigan, lawmakers are hoping to tap into this growing market and create new jobs and revenue for the state.

So far there are no plans to launch any state-run online casinos, but private companies are expected to apply for licenses soon. Operators will be required to pay a licensing fee of $200,000, and they will also be taxed at a rate of 21%.

For now, residents can only gamble on websites that are licensed in other states. But there are plans to eventually allow Michigan-based casinos to offer their services online as well. This would give players greater choice and likely result in better deals for them.

So far there has been mixed reaction to the news of legal online gambling in Michigan. Some people feel that it is risky and could lead to addiction problems for some residents. Others see it as a positive development that will create jobs and generate tax revenue for the state.

No matter what you think about it, gambling is now legal in Michigan and residents can start betting online today!

#  Official: Online gambling coming to Michigan

Michigan has been given the green light to offer regulated online gambling, with

Gov. Rick Snyder signing a bill into law on Tuesday.

The new law permits online casinos, poker, and betting on horse races, and will

be administered by the Michigan Gaming Control Board. Operators must be licensed

by the board, and players must be at least 21 years of age.

The bipartisan bill was passed by the state legislature in December, and is seen as a way to help combat illegal gambling operations in Michigan. It had strong support from the casino industry, who see it as a way to compete with neighboring states that have already legalized online gambling.

"This new law authorizing internet gambling in Michigan helps ensure that our state has robust consumer protections in place," Snyder said in a statement. "I thank everyone who worked on this legislation for their hard work on behalf of Michigan residents."
