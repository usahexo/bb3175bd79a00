#  One Hundred and Eleven Years Old and Still Going Strong!

On July 4, 1906, the United States of America celebrated its 100th birthday. As the country looked back on its first century, it had much to be proud of. The nation had seen times of great prosperity and progress, as well as dark times of war and hardship. But through it all, the American people had persevered, and the country continued to grow and thrive.

Now, more than a century later, the United States is still going strong. This year, on July 4th again, America will celebrate its 111th birthday with a new generation of patriots. And once again, the nation has much to be proud of.

Since its inception, America has been a land of opportunity and freedom. It is a place where anyone can achieve anything they set their mind to – no matter their race or religion. And while there have been bumps in the road along the way, America remains the greatest country in the world.

This Fourth of July, let’s take a moment to reflect on all that our country has accomplished. Let’s honor those who came before us and fought for our freedoms. And let’s commit ourselves to making America even stronger in the years to come.

Happy Fourth of July!

#  Bingo from Bluey Chumba Casino - A Fixture on the Australian Scene for Over a Century!

Bingo is one of the most popular casino games in the world, enjoyed by millions of people in casinos and at home. The origins of the game are a little murky, but it is thought to have originated in Italy in the early 16th century. It has been around for centuries and is still a popular pastime today.

The rules of Bingo are simple - players mark off numbers on their cards as they are drawn from a container, until they have a line of five. The first player to achieve this wins the game. There are different variations of the game, including coverall games where players have to cover all the squares on their cards in order to win.

Bingo can be played with any type of card, although most casinos use special sheets that have 25 squares in five rows and five columns. Players purchase cards for a set price and then take turns calling out numbers. The caller is usually found in the middle of the table and will draw balls from a large container numbered 1-75 (or more). As each number is called, players mark it off on their cards. When a player has a line of five numbers, they call out 'Bingo!'

Bingo is a social game and is often played in groups. It's great for people who want to play something relatively fast-paced and exciting without having to learn lots of complicated rules. There are lots of different variants of the game, so players never get bored. It's also perfect for those who enjoy gambling as there is some element of chance involved - even if you're playing with friends, you never know when someone might get lucky and win the game!
