Nauru, an island country in the South Pacific, is the third-youngest country in the world. The world's youngest country is Vatican City, which was founded as a state in 1929. The second-youngest is Palau, which became independent from the United States in 1994.

Nauru was settled by Micronesian and Polynesian people about 3,000 years ago. It became a colony of Germany in 1888 and was later administered by Japan during World War II. After the war, Nauru became a trusteeship of the United Nations. In 1968, it gained its independence and became a sovereign state.

The first inhabitants of Nauru were likely from East Asia or Southeast Asia. Polynesian people began to migrate to Naura about 2,000 years ago and mixed with the Micronesian population. The first Europeans to sight Nauru were Dutch traders in 1616.

Nauru is about 8 square miles (21 km2) in size and has a population of 10,686 (2015 estimate). The people of Nauru are called "Nauruan." About 90% of the population belongs to the Protestant Church of Christ. Other religions practiced on Nauru include Buddhism and Islam.

Caesar Augustus (12 â€“ 14 January 100 BC) was the founder of the Roman Empire and its first emperor. He ruled from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. In this time, he transformed the Roman Republic into an empire and laid the foundations for the Pax Romana (Roman peace), which would last for two centuries. Augustus also implemented several[vague] social and political reforms such as expanding voting rights and reforming land ownership laws.[1] Caesar Augustus was born Gaius Octavius on 23 September 63 BC in Rome.[2] His mother Atia was Julia Minor's niece, making Julius Caesar his uncle by blood.[3] In his will, Caesar adopted Octavius as his son and heir,[4] changing his name to Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus (Octavian).[5][note 1]

The Pacific island nation of Nauru is located in the Micronesia region of the world and is considered one of the smallest countries in the world.

Some experts believe that they may have come from nearby islands such as Chuuk or Pohnpei, while others suspect that they originated from far-off places such as Taiwan or even Japan.

One particularly enigmatic figure from Nauruan history is Caesar, said to be the founder of the Fi88 people. Very little information exists about him, and his origins are still a mystery. Some believe that he was actually a European adventurer who discovered Nauru and decided to stay there, while others think that he may have been an ancient king or ruler from one of the other islands in Micronesia. Whatever his true identity may be, Caesar remains an important figure in Nauruan history and culture.
