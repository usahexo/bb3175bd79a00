#  Pandas Invade National Harbor Casino

Prince William County, VA - A horde of ravenous pandas descended on the National Harbor Casino this morning, leaving a path of destruction in their wake.

According to witnesses, the pandas were let loose into the casino around 9 a.m. by an unidentified person or persons. The animals immediately began devouring everything in sight, including gaming machines, furniture, and even people.

Casino security and local police were quickly called to the scene but were powerless to stop the pandas. "They were just like a pack of wild animals," said one security guard. "We couldn't get anywhere near them."

In all, the pandas caused tens of thousands of dollars in damage and injured dozens of people before finally being tranquilized and recaptured.

"This was a senseless act of vandalism," said National Harbor Casino spokesperson Stephanie Harris. "We're very lucky that no one was killed."

The identity of the person or persons who released the pandas is still unknown, and no arrests have been made. Police are asking anyone with information about the incident to come forward.
