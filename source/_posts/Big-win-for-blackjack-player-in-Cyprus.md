#  Big win for blackjack player in Cyprus

A blackjack player has won a huge €1.7 million payout at a casino in Cyprus, making it the biggest ever win on the game in the country.

The lucky player, who has not been named, was playing at the Casino Admiral in Limassol when they hit the jackpot on a single hand of blackjack.

The casino has confirmed that the win is the largest blackjack payout ever recorded in Cyprus.

Blackjack is a popular casino game in which players try to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over. In order to win, players must first make an initial bet, and then draw cards until they either reach 21 or go bust.

In this particular hand, the player’s first two cards were an Ace and a Ten, giving them a total of 21 straight away. The dealer then drew a five, giving them a total of 16. Since the player had already beaten the dealer’s total of 16, they automatically won the hand and took home €1.7 million.

Casino Admiral director Savvas Aspros said that he was delighted for the player and that they were welcome back at any time. He added that this big win would inspire other players to give blackjack a go at the casino.

This latest win comes after another big jackpot payout was made last month at the same casino. In that case, a British woman won €1 million on a single hand of roulette.

#  Royal flush leads to big payout at blackjack table in Cyprus

When a royal flush hit the blackjack tables at the Kundura Casino Resort in Cyprus, everyone knew there would be a big payout. The lucky player, who has chosen to remain anonymous, took home over €100,000 from the one hand win.

The casino resort is located in the town of Ayia Napa on the southeast coast of the Mediterranean island nation. It is one of the largest and most popular casinos in Europe, and this royal flush hand is sure to bring even more players through its doors.

Blackjack is a simple game, but also one with plenty of potential for big wins. Players are dealt two cards each, and then take turns trying to get as close to 21 as possible while not going over. The ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, so it’s important to keep track of what other cards are still out there.

The royal flush is the highest possible hand in blackjack, and it’s composed of an ace, king, queen, jack and ten all of the same suit. When this happens at the casino table, all other players automatically lose - no matter what their hands are. This makes for some pretty exciting moments when it happens!

In this case, the player had bet €5 per hand and ended up winning a total of €105,000 on the single hand - turning a modest profit into a life-changing windfall overnight. In fact, if they had been playing at a table where bets were higher - say €100 per hand - they would have walked away with an incredible €1 million jackpot!

As far as casino wins go, this ranks among some of the biggest ever recorded. It just goes to show that Lady Luck can smile down on anyone at any time, so always be ready to roll the dice (or cards!) and hope for the best.

As well as taking home the colossal sum of money, the player is also celebrating becoming one of the biggest winners in casino history. The previous record at the Venetian casino was set by another blackjack player who scooped €1 million with a four of a kind.

It's not only casinos that are offering big payouts to blackjack players these days either - online casinos are getting in on the action too. One lucky gamer recently won an incredible $2.7 million playing blackjack at an online casino.

So what is it about this classic card game that is making players so rich? The answer lies in its simplicity - blackjack is easy to learn and easy to play, which makes it perfect for anyone looking for an adrenaline rush and some serious cash payouts.
